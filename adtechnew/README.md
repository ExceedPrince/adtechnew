# React + Vite

This is a To-Do project which uses the localStorage as the source of the list items.
This project has been created with React + Vite, and designed with Tailwind CSS and Shadcn.

# What does it do?

1. Add new element to the list by clicking on the "+" button or pressing enter

2. Empty or already existing element cannot be added to the list

3. Delete items by clicking on the "-" button

4. Edit existing list item by clicking on its text

5. Editing can be accepted (button click or enter) or cancelled

6. The list shows 10 pieces of list item at once. In case of having more then 10 the pagination component will show up

7. While editing the pagination component is unavailable

8. Most of the actions create a popup, which can be informative (simple) or alerting (destructive)

9. Closing or refreshing the application won't delete the list

10. Design is responsive
